## Reflections and Stories

In 2019, Bryn Mawr's Library and Information Technology Services was invited to participate in Book Traces, a multi-institution data collection effort led by Andrew Stauffer and Kristin Jensen at University of Virginia, by surveying books in our collections for reader markings and interventions. Mawrginalia aims to highlight some of the strange and fascinating marginal notes and other markings our team found in Bryn Mawr College library books, many of which were donated from the personal collections of administrators, professors, and notable figures in the college’s history. Whether scribbles, annotations, inserts, or owners’ names, readers leave traces of themselves on the pages, rendering each book copy unique. The project explores how people have interacted with books not just as texts, but also as material objects, shedding new light on Bryn Mawr’s library holdings.

This book was signed by Mary Garrett on June 18, 1880. An interesting character and quite a role in Bryn Mawr History. One wonders what she thought of Fanny Burney's letters, indeed, if anything.

But what should a story look like? How do I include the necessary elements to make it a path?
